# Python_Traverse_Files
Create a Reporting Script for File Sizes
Specific instructions for the project

In this project, the goal is for you to create a Python script in a single file that will traverse the filesystem finding the largest files in a path.

You will use the following 
* Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/alfredodeza/mapping-data/blob/main/looping-data-structures.ipynb that has examples on how to walk the filesystem, and this 
* Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/alfredodeza/python-scripting/blob/main/large-files.ipynb that captures size information from files.

Your Tasks

1. Create a new Github repository with a README and a single python file.
2. Make your Python script accept an argument to traverse any path (don't hardcode the path!)
3. Use different options in the script for reporting, like:
* No more than 20 files
* Files larger  than a specific size in megabytes
4. Complete the Demo project in GitHub with a README.md that describes what you did.
5. Create a Demo Video and reference it in your GitHub Project.

* Bonus: Try adding options to your script like a help menu, or matching specific names or suffixes. For example finding files that end in .mp3
